Description: # mkdocs-pug
        
        This MkDocs plugin is based on [pypugjs](https://github.com/kakulukia/pypugjs).
        
        To install:
        
        ```
        pip install mkdocs_pug
        ```
        
        To use, add this to your `mkdocs.yml`:
        
        
        ```
        plugins:
          - mkdocs_pug
        ```
        
        Then, this plugin will watch for `*.pug` files in your template directories and build the corresponding `*.html` files in the same location.
        
        To do this automatically with the server during development, you should run with
        
        ```
        mkdocs serve --watch-theme
        ```
        
        This repo contains an example of how to use this plugin inside an MkDocs project.
