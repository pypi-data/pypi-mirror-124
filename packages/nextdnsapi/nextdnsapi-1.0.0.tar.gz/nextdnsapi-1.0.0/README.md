## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

I was getting increasingly frustrated with NextDNS's lack of API. I wanted to manage things on the fly. So, I did the most logical thing. I built a python script (library-to-be) to control my NextDNS account. I decided to make it public because why not?

## Built With

Built using Python:
- Requests library
