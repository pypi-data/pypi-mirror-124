Description: The *wai.tflite_model_maker* library offers command-line tools for training tflite
        models and applying them.
        
        The following domains are supported:
        
        * image classification
        * object detection
        
        For making predictions, the following approaches are available:
        
        * single image
        * batch/continuous processing using file-polling
        * continuous processing via a Redis backend (for receiving images and sending predictions back to)
