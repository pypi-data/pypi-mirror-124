## Notes on use with the CodeChat System
All configuration files were generated using the command `mdbook init mdbook`. The CodeChat project configuration file, `codechat_config.yaml`, has a `source_path` setting of `src` and an `output_path` setting of `book`to match the standard mdbook configuration.

To use these files, simply copy them to a new project directory of your choice. Open them in your preferred text editor/IDE, then use a appropriate CodeChat extension/plugin to open any of these files to build and view the results.
