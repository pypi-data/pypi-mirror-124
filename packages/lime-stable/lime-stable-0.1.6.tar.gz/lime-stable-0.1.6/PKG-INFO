        This project provides a set of tools to fit emission lines from ionized spectra for a posterior chemical and kinematic analysis
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        The current beta version has been developed for the ULS students and researchers.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The current version does not include a package installation. The library source folder (../lime/src/) needs to be
        added to the python path manually. For example you may add the following lines at the begining of your scripts to import the library: ::
        
            import sys
            src_lime_folder = '\folder\to\lime\src'
            sys.path.append(src_lime_folder)
            import lime
