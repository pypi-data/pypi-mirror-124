# Dashborg Python SDK

Dashborg is a SDK that plugs directly into any backend service or script.  With a couple lines of code you can register any running function with the Dashborg service and then build secure, modern, interactive tools on top of those functions using a simple, JavaScript free, HTML template language.

Dashborg saves you time by handling all of the tedious details of frontend app creation and deployment (hosting, end-to-end security, authentication, transport, UI libraries, JavaScript frameworks, CSS frameworks, etc.).

Dashborg works great for debugging, introspecting the running state of servers, viewing/updating configuration values, bite-sized internal tools, status pages, and reports.

Dashborg is easy to get started with.  You can have your first app deployed in 5-minutes (no account/registration required).  Free tier covers most simple use cases.
