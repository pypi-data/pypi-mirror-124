        This call creates multiple offers (up to 25) for specific inventory items on a specific eBay marketplace. Although it is not a requirement for the seller to create complete offers (with all necessary details) right from the start, eBay recommends that the seller provide all necessary details with this call since there is currently no bulk operation available to update multiple offers with one call. The following fields are always required in the request payload: sku, marketplaceId, and (listing) format. Other information that will be required before a offer can be published are highlighted below: Inventory location Offer price Available quantity eBay listing category Referenced listing policy profiles to set payment, return, and fulfillment values/settings Note: Though the includeCatalogProductDetails parameter is not required to be submitted in the request, the parameter defaults to true if omitted. If the call is successful, unique offerId values are returned in the response for each successfully created offer. The offerId value will be required for many other offer-related calls. Note that this call only stages an offer for publishing. The seller must run either the publishOffer, bulkPublishOffer, or publishOfferByInventoryItemGroup call to convert offer(s) into an active single- or multiple-variation listing. In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the bulkCreateOffer call also requires the Content-Language header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload. For US English, the code value passed in this header should be en-US. To view other supported Content-Language values, and to read more about all supported HTTP headers for eBay REST API calls, see the HTTP request headers topic in the Using eBay RESTful APIs document.
