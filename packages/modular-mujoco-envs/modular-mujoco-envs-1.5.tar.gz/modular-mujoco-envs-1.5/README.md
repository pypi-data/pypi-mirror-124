# Modular MuJoCo Environments

Collection of modular MuJoCo environments for benchmarking morphology agnostic reinforcement learning algorithms. The contained environments are primarily based on the paper "One Policy to Control Them All: Shared Modular Policies for Agent-Agnostic Control" by Wenlong Huang, Igor Mordatch, and Deepak Pathak, from ICML 2020.

## Installation

```bash
pip install modular-mujoco-envs
```
