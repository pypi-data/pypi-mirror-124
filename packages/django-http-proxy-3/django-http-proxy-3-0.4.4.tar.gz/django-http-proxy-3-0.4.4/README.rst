Django HTTP Proxy
=================

Django HTTP Proxy provides simple HTTP proxy functionality for the Django web
development framework.

Features
--------

* Configure one or more HTTP proxies in your Django project.
* Avoid typical cross-domain issues while developing an Ajax application based
  on live data from another server.
* Record responses and play them back at a later time:
    * Use "live" data, even when you are developing offline
    * Speedy responses instead of having to wait for a remote server
* Manually edit recorded responses via the Django admin interface

Documentation can be found on 
`Read the Docs <http://django-http-proxy.readthedocs.org/>`_.
