def insertion_sort(given_array):
    """
    Implement the **insertion sort** algorithm to sort `given_array` in place.

    Iteratively sort `given_array` moving from left to right. This algorithm
    is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements.

    Complexity:
    ----------
    - O(n^2)
    Note: Merge sort run time complexity ( O(n*log(n)) ) is beneficial for
        larger arrays. Due to run time constants, insertion sort is likely
        beneficial for shorter arrays.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    - given_array (list) : a numerical sequence

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    - TypeError

def merge_sort(given_array):
    """
    Implement the **merge sort** algorithm to sort `given_array` in place.

    Sorts `given_array` by recursively dividing the it into two smaller
    lists, sorting those, and then merging them all back together later.

    Complexity:
    ----------
    - O(n*log(n))
        Note: Although merge sort run time complexity is less than insertion sort
        ( O(n^2) ), the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster
        in practice for small problem sizes on many machines.

    Implement the **bubble sort** algorithm to sort `given_array` in place.

    Repeatedly steps through a list, comparing adjacent elements, and
