Before you provision the environment, have a look at the the following file:

ec2-scylla/variables.tf

And modify the variables like the machine types etc.

To provision the environment, execute the following:

provision_terraform

The first time this script is called, it will create the following EC2 resources:
- security groups
- keypair
- the Scylla machine(s)
- Scylla monitor machine
- load generator machine(s).

There are 2 script that will run a benchmark:

- scylla-bench.py
- cassandra-stress.py

To run the scylla-bench, execute the following:

./scylla-bench.py

To run cassandra-stress, execute the following:

./cassandra-stress.py

Probably you want to delete one of the script and start modifying it.

After the benchmark completes, you can find the results in the following directory:

trials/dummy-benchmark/

After you are finished with running your benchmark, you can destroy the environment using:

unprovision_terraform

This will destroy all the created EC2 resources. If you automatically want to destroy the 
environment after completing the benchmark, uncomment the last part of the benchmark.py file.
