# PrettyPrints

> A must-have for all lazy python enthusiasts who wants pretty prints in the terminal window!

Is what I would like to say, but to be real, I am probably the only one who gets annoyed at ugly prints from my python script when I resize my terminal window.   

**This python package is 100% more work than what is worth.**
