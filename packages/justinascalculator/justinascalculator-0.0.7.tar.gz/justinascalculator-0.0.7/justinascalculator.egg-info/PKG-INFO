Description: This is a simple calculator, that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising by power and taking the (n) root of a number.
        
        Introduction:
            This package was built as a Turing College task for 1.5 subproject. Each action updates the number in calculator's memory and returns result.
        
        Usage:
            Functions:
                memory: returns or sets a number in memory
                reset_memory: resets memory to 0
                addition(float or int): adds number to memory
                subtraction(float or int): subtract number from memory
                multiplication(float or int): multiply number from memory
                division(float or int): divides number form memory
                nth_root(float or int): takes the (n)'th root from memory
                power(float or int): raises number by power
                
        Installation:
            Install the package from pypi using: pip install justinascalculator
        
        Initialise:
            from calculator.Calculator import Calculator
            calculator = Calculator()
