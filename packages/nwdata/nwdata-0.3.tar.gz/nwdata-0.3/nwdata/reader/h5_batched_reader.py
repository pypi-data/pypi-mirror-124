# H5 Batched Dataset Reader. By default H5 datasets are batched datasets, but we can make more asusmptions about it
#  based on the stored dataset. We can use a default dim getter (instead of providing one manually) that reads a batch
#  of data from the h5 file. We can also know ahead of time the number of data, so we don't need to provide this
#  information at all. Basically, all we need to do is to make a exporter file that will put the data in h5 form and
#  provide a good enough dataBuckets/dimTransform combination and this reader will take care of the rest.
# See mnist exporter/reader for this.
