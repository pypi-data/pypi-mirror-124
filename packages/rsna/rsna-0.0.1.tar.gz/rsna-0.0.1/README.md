# Key Takeaways

## [Changing Random Seeds can get you from 0.540 to 0.710 in no time](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/discussion/271214)


For an in-depth comparison of the various models such as b0 vs b1 vs b2 or b0 with different seeds, head over to the [**accompanying wandb report**](https://wandb.ai/sauravmaheshkar/RSNA-MICCAI/reports/The-Fluke--VmlldzoxMDA2MDQy).

The motivation for these experiments come from [Chai Time Kaggle Talks with Anjum Sayed (Datasaurus)](https://youtu.be/udw-uSV66EQ) Video on the [Weights and Biases Channel](https://www.youtube.com/WeightsBiases). Anjum mentioned that a good way to check if the models are learning anything is to just change the random seeds and see if it affects the performance.
