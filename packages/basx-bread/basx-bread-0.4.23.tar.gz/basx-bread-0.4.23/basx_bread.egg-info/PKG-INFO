Important

This repo is in alpha-stage and highly experimental. We will not keep any backwards-compatability during the next few months. We work on improving stability as well as adding documentation and tests.

- [x] Create pip-distribution
- [ ] Review test-system, make test-runner
- [x] Enforce python standards: black, isort, flake8, bandit (https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/compatible_configs.md, for black-flake8)
