Napari plugin for loading Bitplane Imaris files '.ims'.  


## Notes:
**For this plugin to work "File/Preferences/Experimental/Render Images Asynchronously" must be selected.**

### Features

* Multiscale Rendering
  * Image pyramids which are present in the native IMS format are automatically added to napari during file loading.
* Chunks are implemented by dask and matched to the chunk sizes stored in each dataset.  (Napari appears to only ask for 2D chunks - unclear how helpful this feature is currently)
* Successfully handles multi-terabyte multi-channel datasets (see unknowns).

### Known Issues / limitations

* Currently, this is **only an image loader**, and there are no features for loading or viewing objects
* Napari sometimes throws errors indicating that it expected a 3D or 5D array but receives the other.
  * This sometimes *but relatively rarely* causes napari to crash
  * The IMS class used in the reader represents all arrays to napari as a 5D dask.array (tczyx).  This is necessary because IMS only stores data as 3D arrays separated by time and color.  For example a 1 Timepoint / 1 Color, 3D 100x1024x1024px volume would have dimensions (1,1,100,1024,1024) and would be handed to napari as a 5D array rather than 3D.  Working on a fix for this.
  * Would like to enable Asynchronous Tiling of Images, but this results in more instability and causes crashes.
* The lowest resolution level in the IMS file is often too small for detailed 3D renderings.
  * Currently this is limited by the lowest resolution level being used by napari for 3D.
* Contrast_Limits are currently determined by dtype and not the actual data.
  * float: [0,1], uint8: [0,254], uint16: [0,65534]
  * Future implementations may use the HistogramMax parameter to determine this.
* 3D rendering works, but it is suggested to turn on 1 channel at a time starting from the highest channel to avoid some OpenGL errors and misalignment errors.
  * For example: Turn on only Channel 1, activate 3D rendering, then turn on Channel 0.

### Unknowns

* Time series data has not been tested, but it has been designed to work.

## Installation

You can install `napari-imaris-loader` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-imaris-loader

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.  Test only verifies that the loader is callable.  I plan to implement testing over a real '.ims' file in the future.
