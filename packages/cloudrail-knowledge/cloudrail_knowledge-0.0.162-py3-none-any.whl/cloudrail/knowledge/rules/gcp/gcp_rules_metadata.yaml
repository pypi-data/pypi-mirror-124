    name: Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are not open to the world
    severity: major
    description: To minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be allowedto connect to it. An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0/0 which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world. Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that database connections are not permitted from 0.0.0.0/0.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_sql_database_instance resource, set the authorized Networks parameter under ipConfiguration subblock to value other than 0.0.0.0/0.
      console:  Follow the guide at <https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances> in order to audit and delete any authorized networks with 0.0.0.0/0.
