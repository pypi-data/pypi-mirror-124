Description: PyFBA
        =====
        
        A python implementation of flux balance analysis to model microbial
        metabolism
        
        About PyFBA
        -----------
        
        PyFBA is a Python flux-balance-analysis package that allows you to build
        models from genomes, gapfill models, and run flux-balance-analysis on
        that model. The aim of PyFBA is to provide an extensible, python-based
        platform for FBA work.
        
        PyFBA is being developed by Daniel Cuevas, Taylor O'Connell, and Rob
        Edwards in Rob's bioinformatics group at Flinders University,
        together with help from Janaka Edirisinghe, Chris Henry, Ross Overbeek
        and others at Argonne National Labs.
        
        Installing PyFBA
        ----------------
        
        We recommend that you install PyFBA using conda: 
        
        conda create -n pyfba -c bioconda pyfba
        
        You can also install PyFBA from PyPi using pip and you will need
        Python 3 or greater, and you need to install the GNU GLPK and a 
        Python wrapper for that program, pyGLPK available from GitHub.
        
        Our installation page has detailed instructions on installing PyFBA and
        getting everything running.
        
        Getting Started with PyFBA
        --------------------------
        
        Once you have installed GLPK, PyGLPK, and PyFBA, you will most likely
        want to build a model from a genome, gap fill that model, and test it
        for growth on different media. We have detailed instructions that walk
        you through the step-by-step procedures that you need to use to run flux
        balance analysis on your own genome.
