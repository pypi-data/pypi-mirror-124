(b) include all applicable copyright notices and author lists from the Open Databases from which they were derived; and

(c) identify or summarize all modifications that were made.

Any distribution of such Modified Open Databases without the required notices is a violation of SRI's and its licensors' copyright and other proprietary rights.
