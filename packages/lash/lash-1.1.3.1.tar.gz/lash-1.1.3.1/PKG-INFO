        About lash
        ----------
        This package provides a set of desktop tools that simplify and
        automate repetitive processes. Lash also has utility functions
        that cover some needs of desktop users.
        
        Thought to be simple and effective, Lash was developed with a
        command line interface that has self-help and semantic commands.
