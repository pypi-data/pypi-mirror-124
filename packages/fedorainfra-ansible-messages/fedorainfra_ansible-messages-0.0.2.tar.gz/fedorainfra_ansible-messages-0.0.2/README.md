# fedorainfra-ansible messages

A schema package for [the fedora infrastructure ansible](https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/ansible). It defines messages for some scripts that are only kept in ansible, as well as messages ansible itself sends (like when a playbook starts)

See the [detailed documentation](https://fedora-messaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messages.html) on packaging your schemas.
