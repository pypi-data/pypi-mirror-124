=======

Library of unspeakably useful functions. This is not ready for public use yet.

Installation with ``pip``
-----------------------------

The simplest way is to clone the repository and then from within the cloned folder run (Windows user from the Anaconda Prompt):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .

Installation with ``pip`` (elegant via ``git``\ )
-------------------------------------------------------

The handy way is to first install ``git``. Linux users just use their respective repos. Look into `this repo <https://github.com/gboehl/pydsge/blob/master/README.rst>` for details.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/gboehl/grgrlib
