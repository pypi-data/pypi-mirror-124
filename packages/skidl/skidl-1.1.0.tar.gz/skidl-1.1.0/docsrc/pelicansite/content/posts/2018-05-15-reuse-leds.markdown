Sometimes you need a quick circuit that does one, specific thing.
Other times, you want to create a general design that can be re-used in multiple instances.
I'll demonstrate the evolution from a specific to a general SKiDL design using a simple set of LEDs.


### Four LEDs

Here's a simple SKiDL module that instantiates four common-cathode LEDs with
current limiting resistors:

```py
def leds(inp0, inp1, inp2, inp3, gnd):

    # Create four LEDs and resistors.
    leds = 4 * Part("Device", 'LED', footprint='KiCad/LEDs.pretty:LED_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)
    rs = 4 * Part("Device", 'R', value='330', footprint='KiCad/Resistors_SMD.pretty:R_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)

    # Connect anodes (+) of LEDs to inputs.
    leds[0]['A'] += inp0
    leds[1]['A'] += inp1
    leds[2]['A'] += inp2
    leds[3]['A'] += inp3

    # Connect current-limiting resistors between LED cathodes (-) and ground.
    rs[0][1,2] += leds[0]['K'], gnd
    rs[1][1,2] += leds[1]['K'], gnd
    rs[2][1,2] += leds[2]['K'], gnd
    rs[3][1,2] += leds[3]['K'], gnd
```

This module is simple, to-the-point, and limited to four LEDs.
But sometimes you'll want more than that, other times, less.
The next module adds that flexibility.


### Pick-A-Size LEDs

The module below supports any number of common-cathode LEDs by querying the
number of lines in the input bus and instantiating the required number of components:

```py
def leds(inps, gnd):

    # Use the width of the input bus to set the number of LEDs and resistors.
    leds = inps.width * Part("Device", 'LED', footprint='KiCad/LEDs.pretty:LED_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)
    rs = inps.width * Part("Device", 'R', value='330', footprint='KiCad/Resistors_SMD.pretty:R_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)

    # Zip the inputs, LEDs, and resistors together so there is one input
    # associated with each LED and resistor. Then, connect them together.
    for inp, led, r in zip(inps, leds, rs):
        led['A'] += inp          # Connect an LED anode to an input.
        r[1,2] += led['K'], gnd  # Connect a resistor between the LED cathode and ground.
```

This is more flexible, but a bit less clear and still limited to building
common-cathode LEDs (where the LEDs are turned on by raising their inputs
to a positive voltage).
But I'm out of luck if I want common anode LEDs that light up when I lower
their inputs to ground.
The next module adds that capability.


### Common-Cathode or Anode?

The code below supports both common-cathode and common-anode LED configurations
by allowing either the anode or the cathode inputs to be a bus controlling the
individual LEDs while the other input is the common terminal: 

```py
def leds(anodes, cathodes):

    # Either the anode will be connected to VCC or the cathode will be connected
    # to ground and will have a width of 1. The width of the other input bus will
    # determine the number of LEDs.
    width = max(anodes.width, cathodes.width)

    leds = width * Part("Device", 'LED', footprint='KiCad/LEDs.pretty:LED_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)
    rs = width * Part("Device", 'R', value='330', footprint='KiCad/Resistors_SMD.pretty:R_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)

    # Zip the LEDs and resistors together so there is one LED associated with
    # each resistor. Then, connect them together.
    for led, r in zip(leds, rs):
        led['K'] += r[1]

    # Now connect the anodes inputs to the LED anodes. If anodes is a single wire,
    # then all the LED anodes will connect to it (common anode). But if the anodes
    # input is a multi-wire bus, each LED anode will connect to its own bus line.
    anodes += [led['A'] for led in leds]

    # Finally, connect the cathodes input to the other end of the resistors.
    # If cathodes is a single wire, then all the LED cathodes will connect to
    # it through their current limiting resistors (common cathode). But if
    # the cathodes input is a multi-wire bus, each LED cathode will connect
    # to its own bus line.
    cathodes += [r[2] for r in rs]
```

As a test of the module, I attached three, common-cathode LEDs to a PIC18F
microcontroller unit like this:

```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    v3_3 = Net('+3.3V')
    gnd = Net('GND')
    mcu = Part('MCU_Microchip_pic18', 'pic18f2450-IML', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:QFN-28')
    mcu['VDD'] += v3_3
    mcu['VSS'] += gnd
    leds(mcu['RA2, RA3, RA4'], gnd)  # Attach 3 common-cathode LEDs.
    ERC()
    generate_netlist()
```

And here's a layout for the netlist that was generated:

![Common-cathode LEDs attached to PIC18F MCU.](images/reuse-leds/leds2.png)

So far, so good. The module is even more general-purpose but it's a bit cost-inefficient
to use all those discrete resistors for limiting the LED current.
The next version of the module will remedy that.


### Using Resistor Arrays

Replacing discrete resistors with
[Resistor arrays](https://www.ctscorp.com/wp-content/uploads/74x.pdf)
containing two, four, or eight independent resistors will lower
the number of components and reduce assembly costs.

![An eight-resistor array.](images/reuse-leds/742c163.png)

![Resistor pinouts.](images/reuse-leds/resistor-pinouts.png)

The following code iteratively packs the resistors into one or more arrays
until all the inputs are connected:

```py
def leds(anodes, cathodes):

    width = max(anodes.width, cathodes.width)

    leds = width * Part("Device", 'LED', footprint='KiCad/LEDs.pretty:LED_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)

    # Get various types of resistors.
    R   = Part("Device", 'R',        value='330', footprint='KiCad/Resistors_SMD.pretty:R_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)
    RN2 = Part("Device", 'R_Pack02', value='330', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:CTS_742C043', dest=TEMPLATE)
    RN4 = Part("Device", 'R_Pack04', value='330', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:CTS_742C083', dest=TEMPLATE)
    RN8 = Part("Device", 'R_Pack08', value='330', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:CTS_742C163', dest=TEMPLATE)

    # Store the resistor types such that their position in the list corresponds
    # to their use for a specific number of resistors. For example, RN4 is at
    # list index 5 so it would be selected if five resistors were needed.
    # (Of course, a four-resistor array would still leave one resistor to be
    # assigned to some other array.)
    #            0   1   2    3    4    5    6    7    8
    r_types = [None, R, RN2, RN4, RN4, RN4, RN8, RN8, RN8]

    # The bus width indicates the number of LEDs (and, hence, the number of
    # resistors) that are needed. Pick the best resistor array and subtract its
    # size from the number of resistors that are needed. If more resistors are
    # still required, repeat the loop until the number drops to zero.
    r_needed = width  # The number of resistors that are currently needed.
    rs = []           # Store the selected resistors here.
    left_pins = []    # List of pins on the left side of the selected resistors.
    right_pins = []   # List of pins on the right side of the selected resistors.

    while r_needed > 0:  # Loop as long as resistors are needed.

        # Pick the best resistor for the current number of resistors that are needed.
        # If the needed number is larger than the list of resistors, then pick
        # the largest available resistor array (which will be at the end of the list).
        try:
            r_type = r_types[r_needed]
        except IndexError:
            r_type = r_types[-1]  # Pick the largest resistor array.

        r = r_type()  # Instantiate the selected resistor.
        rs.append(r)  # Add the resistor to the list of selected resistors.

        num_pins = len(r.pins)  # Number of pins on the selected resistor's package.
        num_resistors = num_pins // 2  # Each resistor takes up two pins on the package.

        # Store the pins on the left and right sides of the resistor.
        # The pins increase from 1 ... num_pins/2 on the left side, and decrease from
        # num_pins ... num_pins/2+1 on the right side. This keeps the left and
        # right pins of each resistor in the package aligned between the lists.
        left_pins.extend( r[       1:num_pins//2  ])
        right_pins.extend(r[num_pins:num_pins//2+1])

        # Subtract the resistors in the selected package from the number that
        # are needed and loop until that number goes to zero.
        r_needed -= num_resistors

    # The number of resistors needed may not fit exactly into the number of 
    # resistors selected (e.g., an eight-resistor array might be used when seven
    # resistors are needed). Therefore, trim the pin lists to the number of
    # resistors that are needed. (This may leave some pins on the last-selected
    # array unconnected.) Also, put them on buses so they'll be easy to connect to.
    left_pins  = Bus('', left_pins[0:width])
    right_pins = Bus('', right_pins[0:width])

    anodes += [led['A'] for led in leds]     # Connect LED anodes to anode inputs.
    left_pins += [led['K'] for led in leds]  # Connect LED cathodes to left side of resistors.
    cathodes += right_pins                   # Connect right side of resistors to cathode inputs.
```

Now I'll test the module by attaching five, common-anode LEDs to a microcontroller as follows:

```py
    v3_3 = Net('+3.3V')
    gnd = Net('GND')
    mcu = Part('MCU_Microchip_pic18', 'pic18f2450-IML', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:QFN-28')
    mcu['VDD'] += v3_3
    mcu['VSS'] += gnd
    leds(v3_3, mcu['RA[2:6]'])  # Attach 5 common-anode LEDs.
    ERC()
    generate_netlist()
```

From the layout, you can see the five current-limiting resistors have been packed into a four-resistor
array and an additional discrete resistor:

![Common-anodes LEDs attached to PIC18F MCU.](images/reuse-leds/leds4.png)

Up to this point, all the components used in these modules have been hard-coded.
While I might consider myself a great designer with impeccable taste in choosing parts,
you'll probably still want to select components that match your application.
(You mean an 0603 LED isn't perfect for *everything?*)
This is the last limitation I'll address in this post.


### "But I Want To Use **My** Resistors and LEDs!"

The module shown below uses Python's default argument feature so you can pass
your own choices for components, but it will use the hard-coded components by
default if you don't:

```py
def leds(anodes, cathodes,
        led_type = Part("Device", 'LED', footprint='KiCad/LEDs.pretty:LED_0603', dest=TEMPLATE),
        r_types = [
            None,
            Part("Device", 'R',        value='330', footprint='KiCad/Resistors_SMD.pretty:R_0603', dest=TEMPLATE),
            Part("Device", 'R_Pack02', value='330', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:CTS_742C043', dest=TEMPLATE),
            Part("Device", 'R_Pack04', value='330', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:CTS_742C083', dest=TEMPLATE),

            Part("Device", 'R_Pack08', value='330', footprint='xesscorp/xess.pretty:CTS_742C163', dest=TEMPLATE),
        ],
    ):

    width = max(anodes.width, cathodes.width)

    leds = width * led_type

    # The bus width indicates the number of LEDs (and, hence, the number of

        try:
            r_type = r_types[r_needed]
        except IndexError:
            r_type = r_types[-1]  # Pick the largest resistor array.

        r = r_type()  # Instantiate the selected resistor.
        rs.append(r)  # Add the resistor to the list of selected resistors.

        num_pins = len(r.pins)  # Number of pins on the selected resistor's package.

        left_pins.extend( r[       1:num_pins//2  ])
        right_pins.extend(r[num_pins:num_pins//2+1])

        # Subtract the resistors in the selected package from the number that
        # are needed and loop until that number goes to zero.
        r_needed -= num_resistors

    # The number of resistors needed may not fit exactly into the number of 
    # resistors selected (e.g., an eight-resistor array might be used when seven
    # resistors are needed). Therefore, trim the pin lists to the number of

    anodes += [led['A'] for led in leds]     # Connect LED anodes to anode inputs.
    left_pins += [led['K'] for led in leds]  # Connect LED cathodes to left side of resistors.
    cathodes += right_pins                   # Connect right side of resistors to cathode inputs.
```


### Postmortem

OK, that's it!
I went from a limited module that built four, common-cathode LEDs all the way to
a general-purpose module that handles any number of common-cathode or common-anode LEDs
using a combination of discrete and array resistors.
The price I paid for this generality was more complex, less-understandable code 
and the time it took to write it.
That's because more conditional code is needed to handle different use-cases
and edge conditions.
Often, the extra effort isn't worth it because a circuit is limited to
a narrow set of applications.
But for common-place circuitry (like LEDs, buttons, etc.), the features
supported by SKiDL and Python (querying bus widths, making multiple connections
with a single statement, conditional execution, iterative looping) make the
creation of parameterized, general-purpose modules less tedious.
