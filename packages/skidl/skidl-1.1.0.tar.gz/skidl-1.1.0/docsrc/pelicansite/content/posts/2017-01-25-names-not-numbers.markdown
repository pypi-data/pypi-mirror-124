In my [previous post]({filename}/posts/2017-01-19-building-a-usb-to-jtag-interface-using-skidl.markdown),
I showed how to use SKiDL to describe the circuit for a simple USB-to-JTAG
interface circuit.
That circuit used a PIC32MX microcontroller in a 28-pin SSOP package:

![PIC32MX in a 28-pin SSOP package.](images/names-not-numbers/pic32mx-ssop28.png)

and the corresponding SKiDL code was: 

``` py
pic32 = Part(pic32_lib, 'pic32MX2\*0F\*\*\*B-SSOP28-SOIC28-SPDIP28',
             footprint='Housings_SSOP:SSOP-28_5.3x10.2mm_Pitch0.65mm')
```

I wanted to try using the same processor, but housed in a smaller QFN package:

To do that, I changed the SKiDL code to reference a different part and footprint like this:

``` py
pic32 = Part(pic32_lib, 'pic32MX2\*0F\*\*\*B-QFN28',
             footprint='Housings_DFN_QFN:QFN-28-1EP_6x6mm_Pitch0.65mm')
```

That's it! No other changes were needed because I wrote my SKiDL code to use
pin *names* instead of pin *numbers*.
For example, I connected the 12 MHz crystal to the microcontroller `OSC1` and `OSC2`
pins like this:

``` py
pic32['OSC1, OSC2'] += xtal[3, 1]
```

This works for either version of the microcontroller because they both have
pins named `OSC1` and `OSC2`.
But, if I had made the crystal connections for the microcontroller in the 28-pin SSOP
using pin numbers:

``` py
pic32[9,10] += xtal[3, 1]  # OSC1==9, OSC2==10 for 28-pin SSOP version.
```

then I would have had to change the code when I switched to the QFN packaged version
of the microcontroller:

``` py
pic32[6,7] += xtal[3, 1]  # OSC1==6, OSC2=7 for 28-pin QFN version.
```

Multiply this by the number of pins a device has (which can be over a thousand
for modern-day parts like FPGAs), and you can see how using pin names
reduces the effort and likelihood of errors when making a
design change.

For the new board, I also changed from using a mini USB connector:

``` py
usb_conn = Part(xess_lib, 'USBB', footprint='XESS:UX60SC-MB-5ST')
```

to a micro connector:

``` py
usb_conn = Part(xess_lib, 'USB-MicroB', footprint='XESS:USB-microB-1')
```

Once again, using pin names meant I didn't have to touch the rest of the code:

``` py
usb_conn['D\+, D-, VCC, GND, NC'] += pic32['D\+, D-'], vusb, gnd, NC
```

After the changes to the SKiDL script were done, I just ran it and imported the
netlist into KiCad's `PCBNEW` layout program.
At that point, it didn't matter whether I used pin names or numbers: I still had
to re-route the wire traces on the PCB because the physical location
of the pins had changed. There's no getting around that.
