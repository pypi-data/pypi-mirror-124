title: New 1.1.0 Release
date: 2021-10-22
author: Dave Vandenbout
slug: one-dot-one

It's been nearly half a year since the big 1.0 release.
This release only has a few user-facing changes:

* A KiCad PCB file can now be created directly using the `generate_pcb()` function instead of outputing a netlist that's imported into PCBNEW.
* Part templates can be created with the `PartTmplt()` class instead of using `Part()` with the `dest=TEMPLATE` option.

That doesn't seem like much - and it's not - but I've also been doing some refactoring and fixing
so that features I said *would* work actually *do* work.
(Finding such problems was one of the stated reasons for starting the [circuitsascode](https://github.com/devbisme/circuitsascode) companion repository.)

I also rebuilt the website, switching from Jekyll to Pelican and finally getting the Sphinx-generated API
documentation to look reasonable.

So I keep plugging along. For some reason.
