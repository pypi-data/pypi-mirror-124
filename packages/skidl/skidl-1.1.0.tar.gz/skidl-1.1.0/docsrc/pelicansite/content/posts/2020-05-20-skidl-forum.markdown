title: New SKiDL Forum!

**FYI: The forum has [moved](https://github.com/devbisme/skidl/discussions).**

I created a [Github Discussions forum for SKiDL](https://github.com/devbisme/skidl/discussions).
There, you can ask questions about SKiDL and post about projects you're doing with it.
This will probably be a more convenient channel for such things rather
than opening issues on the SKiDL GitHub repo.

Give it a try and let me know what you think (**on the forum, of course**)!
