<br/>

Features:
* Many types of RCV tabulation implemented.
* Allows weighted ballots.
* Allows for statistics (not tabulation) to be calculated by group (e.g. by precinct).
* Includes parers for most common RCV formats.

## Install

Only tested on Python 3.9 so far.

<br/>

```
pip install rcv-cruncher
```

## Examples

Using 2017 Minneapolis Mayor [Cast Vote Record](https://github.com/fairvotereform/rcv_cruncher/tree/big_changes/src/rcv_cruncher/example/example_cvr/minneapolis2017/2017-mayor-cvr.csv).

### CVR analysis

```python
# reading CVR
import rcv_cruncher as rcvc
import rcv_cruncher.parsers as parsers

cvr_file = '2017-mayor-cvr.csv'

cvr = rcvc.CastVoteRecord(
        jurisdiction='Minneapolis',
        state='MN',
        year='2017',
        office='Mayor',
        parser_func=parsers.cruncher_csv,
        parser_args={'cvr_path': cvr_file}
    )



# add_rule_set - apply some rules to create new a version of CVR.
cvr.add_rule_set('test_rule_set',
                 rcvc.BallotMarks.new_rule_set(
                    combine_writein_marks: bool = True,
                    exclude_writein_marks: bool = True,
                    exclude_duplicate_candidate_marks: bool = False,
                    exclude_overvote_marks: bool = False,
                    exclude_skipped_marks: bool = False,
                    treat_combined_writeins_as_exhaustable_duplicates: bool = False,
                    exhaust_on_duplicate_candidate_marks: bool = False,
                    exhaust_on_overvote_marks: bool = False,
                    exhaust_on_repeated_skipped_marks: bool = False
                 )
            )



# get_candidates - returns BallotMarks object

# no rules applied candidates
candidates = cvr.get_candidates()

# test_rule_set candidates
candidates = cvr.get_candidates('test_rule_set')



# get_cvr_dict - returns dict of lists

# no rules applied cvr data
cvr_dict = cvr.get_cvr_dict()

# test_rule_set candidates
cvr_dict = cvr.get_cvr_dict('test_rule_set')



# stats
cvr_stats = cvr.stats()
```

### Tabulate Election

```python
import rcv_cruncher as rcvc
import rcv_cruncher.parsers as parsers

cvr_file = '2017-mayor-cvr.csv'

rcv = rcvc.SingleWinner(
        jurisdiction='Minneapolis',
        state='MN',
        year='2017',
        office='Mayor',
        parser_func=parsers.cruncher_csv,
        parser_args={'cvr_path': cvr_file},
        exhaust_on_duplicate_candidate_marks=True,
        exhaust_on_overvote_marks=True,
        combine_writein_marks=True
        # ... other rules from BallotMarks.new_rule_set()
    )

rcv.stats()
```

Other tabulation methods:

* STVFractionalBallot - multi-winner fractional ballot transfer (Gregory method).
* Until2 - single winner election run until 2 candidates remain.
* Sequential - multi-winner election that consists on sequential single winner elections (used in Utah).

Other tabulation methods implemented but not yet fully tested:

* STVWholeBallot - multi-winner whole ballot transfer (used in Cambridge).
* BottomsUpTresh - multi-winner election run until all candidates are above input threshold (15% threshold used in 2020 Dem Pres Primaries).


## Functions and Classes
### *class* **BallotMarks**

This class is intended to hold individual lists of ballot marks and provide useful functions for manipulating them. Collections of BallotMarks are used with CastVoteRecord and RCV objects.

#### Variables

* Constants
  * SKIPPED
  * OVERVOTE
  * WRITEIN
  * UNDERVOTE
  * PRETALLY_EXHAUST
  * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED
  * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED_BY_OVERVOTE
  * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED_BY_REPEATED_SKIPPED_RANKING
  * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED_BY_DUPLICATE_RANKING

* Instance:
  * **marks**: List of candidates in rank order
  * **unique_marks**: Set of unique marks in self.marks
  * **unique_candidates**: Set of unique candidates in self.marks. This excludes special marks BallotMarks.SKIPPED and BallotMarks.OVERVOTE
  * **rules**: Dictionary of rules applied to marks. Only one rule set may be applied per object.
  * **inactive_type**: After rules are applied, a string indicated the possible means by which this ballot will be exhausted in an election. They include:
    * UNDERVOTE: All skipped rankings.
    * PRETALLY_EXHAUST: Ballot is left empty after rules are applied and will therefore not even be active in the first round of tabulation.
    * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED_BY_OVERVOTE: The ballot was trucated due the occurrence of an overvote, when rules apply. Whether or not it will exhaust will be determined by how the remaining candidates marked on the ballot perform in the election.
    * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED_BY_REPEATED_SKIPPED_RANKING: The ballot was trucated due the occurrence of two or more skipped marks (that were followed by at least 1 non-skipped mark), when rules apply. Whether or not it will exhaust will be determined by how the remaining candidates marked on the ballot perform in the election.
    * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED_BY_DUPLICATE_RANKING: The ballot was trucated due the occurrence of repeated candidate mark, when rules apply. Whether or not it will exhaust will be determined by how the remaining candidates marked on the ballot perform in the election.
    * MAYBE_EXHAUSTED: All ballot not receiving one of the labels above. These ballots may still be exhausted during tabulation because they failed to rank a finalist candidate.

## Parser Functions

**burlington2006** - parser specific to 2006 Burlington election. Tab-separated file, one ballot per row. Candidate coded rank information starts in the 4th column.

  * Arguments:
    * cvr_path - Path to cvr file. Function will look for a file called 'candidate_codes.csv' in the same directory with one column named 'code' and one named 'candidate'.

**rank_column** - Use for csv file. One ballot per row, with ranking columns appearing in order and named with the word "rank" (e.x. "rank1", "rank2", etc). All other columns are stored as additional ballot information. Include a column 'weight' for weighted ballots.

* Arguments:
    * cvr_path - Path to cvr file. Function will look for a file called 'candidate_codes.csv' in the same directory with one column named 'code' and one named 'candidate'.

**candidate_column** - Use for csv file. One ballot per row, with candidate names appearing as column headers. Integers fill cells under candidate headers indicating marked rank position of column candidate on row *i* ballot. All other columns are stored as additional ballot information. Include a column 'weight' for weighted ballots.

  * Expected files:
    * cvr.csv - record of all ballot marks.
    * candidate_codes.csv - Two column file, one named 'candidate' and one named 'code'. If no candidate codes are used, then these two columns should be identical. Column names listed in this file are used to determine which columns in the csr.csv are candidate rank columns.
