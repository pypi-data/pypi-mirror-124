<h2><img src="https://seleniumbase.io/img/logo6.png" title="SeleniumBase" width="32" /> Recorder Mode</h2>

ðŸ”´ <b>SeleniumBase Recorder Mode</b> lets you record & export browser actions into automation scripts.<br>

<img src="https://seleniumbase.io/cdn/img/sb_recorder_notification.png" title="SeleniumBase" width="380">

ðŸ”´ To activate Recorder Mode, add ``--rec`` OR ``--record`` OR ``--recorder`` to your ``pytest`` run command when running an existing test on Chrome or Edge. (Also add ``-s`` to allow breakpoints, unless you already have a ``pytest.ini`` file present with ``addopts = --capture=no`` in it.)

```bash
pytest TEST_NAME.py --rec -s
```

ðŸ”´ To add manual actions, you'll need to create a breakpoint inside your test to activate "Debug Mode" while in "Recorder Mode": (For reference, "Debug Mode" is also known as the "ipdb debugger".)

```python
import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
```

ðŸ”´ You can also activate Debug Mode at the start of your test by adding ``--trace`` as a ``pytest`` command-line option: (This is useful when running Recorder Mode without any breakpoints.)

```bash
pytest TEST_NAME.py --trace --rec -s
```

ðŸ”´ Once you've reached the breakpoint, you can take control of the browser and add in any actions that you want recorded. The Recorder will capture browser actions on URLs that begin with ``https:``, ``http:``, and ``file:``; (the Recorder won't work on ``data:`` URLS). When you are finished recording, type "``c``" on the command-line and press ``[Enter]`` to let the test continue from the breakpoint. After the test completes, a file called ``TEST_NAME_rec.py`` will be automatically created in the ``./recordings`` folder, which will include the actions performed by the test, and the manual actions that you added in. Below is a command-line notification:

```bash
>>> RECORDING SAVED as: recordings/my_first_test_rec.py
*******************************************************
```

ðŸ”´ If running tests from one module, recordings will share a file:

```bash
>>> RECORDING ADDED to: recordings/my_first_test_rec.py
*******************************************************
```

ðŸ”´ While a recording is in progress, you can hit the ``[ESC]`` key to pause the recording. To resume the recording, you can hit the ``[~`]`` key, which is located directly below the ``[ESC]`` key on most keyboards.

<p>ðŸ”´ If you want to create a recording from scratch, just run:<br><code>pytest --rec</code> on a Python file such as this one:</p>

```python
from seleniumbase import BaseCase

class RecorderTest(BaseCase):
    def test_recorder(self):
        import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
```

<p>ðŸ”´ The above code gives you a basic SeleniumBase file with a breakpoint in it so that you can immediately start recording after you've opened a new web page in the browser.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ Recorder Mode works by saving your recorded actions into the browser's <code>sessionStorage</code>. SeleniumBase then reads from the browser's <code>sessionStorage</code> to take the raw data and generate a full test from it. Keep in mind that <code>sessionStorage</code> is only present for a website while the browser tab remains on a web page of the same domain/origin. If you leave that domain/origin, the <code>sessionStorage</code> of that tab will no longer have the raw data that SeleniumBase needs to create a full recording. To compensate for this, all links to web pages of a different domain/origin will automatically open a new tab for you while in Recorder Mode. Additionally, the SeleniumBase <code>self.open(URL)</code> method will also open a new tab for you in Recorder Mode if the domain/origin is different from the current URL. When the recorded test completes, SeleniumBase will scan the <code>sessionStorage</code> of all open browser tabs for the data it needs to generate the complete SeleniumBase automation script.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ If you just want to record actions on a single URL of a multi-URL test, you can call <code>self.activate_recorder()</code> from within the test instead of using <code>pytest --rec</code> from the command-line. When doing so, make sure that the browser tab is still on the same domain/origin at the end of the test, or else SeleniumBase will not have access to the <code>sessionStorage</code> data that it needs for generating a complete test.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ (Note that <b>same domain/origin</b> is not the same as <b>same URL</b>. Example: <code>https://xkcd.com/353/</code> and <code>https://xkcd.com/1537/</code> are two different URLs with the <b>same domain/origin</b>. That means that both URLs will share the same <code>sessionStorage</code> data, and that any changes to <code>sessionStorage</code> from one URL will carry on to the <code>sessionStorage</code> of a different URL when the domain/origin is the same. If you want to find out a website's origin during a test, just call: <code>self.get_origin()</code>, which returns the value of <code>window.location.origin</code> from the browser's console.)</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ The launch of Recorder Mode has brought a new SeleniumBase method along with it: <code>self.open_if_not_url(URL)</code>. This method will open the URL given if the browser is not currently on that page. This is used as a method in recorded scripts when SeleniumBase detects that a click action has already brought the test to the given page. This method not only prevents an extra page load if not needed, but it also lets people know the current page of the browser during that part of the test.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>1.66.1</code> adds the ability to record changes to <i>"Choose File"</i> <code>input</code> fields. Sometimes the <i>"Choose File"</i> input field is hidden on websites, so <code>self.show_file_choosers()</code> was added to get around this edge case. Version <code>1.66.1</code> also adds <code>self.set_content_to_frame(frame)</code>, which lets you record actions inside of iframes.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>1.66.2</code> adds the ability to save selectors using the <code>":contains(TEXT)"</code> selector. If a Python file being recorded has multiple tests being run, then all those tests will get saved to the generated <code>*_rec.py</code> file. The Recorder will now save common <code>self.assert_*</code> calls made during tests. In order to escape iframes when using <code>self.set_content_to_frame(frame)</code>, a new method was added: <code>self.set_content_to_default()</code>. The <code>self.set_content_to_*()</code> methods will be automatically used in place of <code>self.switch_to_*()</code> methods in Recorder Mode, unless a test explicitly calls <code>self._rec_overrides_switch = False</code> before the <code>self.switch_to_*()</code> methods are called. Additionally, if an iframe contains the <code>src</code> attribute, that page will get loaded in a new tab when switching to it in Recorder Mode.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase versions <code>1.66.3</code>, <code>1.66.4</code>, <code>1.66.5</code>, <code>1.66.6</code>, <code>1.66.7</code>, <code>1.66.8</code>, and <code>1.66.9</code> improve the algorithm for converting recorded actions into SeleniumBase code.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>1.66.10</code> adds better error-handling to the Recorder. It also adds the console script option <code>-r</code> for <code>sbase mkfile</code> to generate a new test file with a breakpoint for Recorder Mode: <code>sbase mkfile NEW_FILE.py -r</code></p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>1.66.12</code> adds the ability to instantly create a new test recording by running <code>sbase mkrec FILE.py</code>. Once the browser spins up, you can open a new web page and start performing actions that will get recorded and saved to the file you specified.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>1.66.13</code> lets you add assertions for elements and text while making a recording. To add an element assertion, press the <code>{^}-key (SHIFT+6)</code>, (the border will become purple) then click on elements that you'd like to assert. To add a text assertion, press the <code>{&}-key (SHIFT+7)</code>, (the border will become orange) then click on text elements that you'd like to assert. To go back to the regular Record Mode, press any other key. While in the special assertion modes, certain actions such as clicking on links won't have any effect. This lets you make assertions on elements without certain actions getting in the way.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>1.66.14</code> improves the algorithm for converting recorded assertions into SeleniumBase code. Text assertions that contain the newline character will now be handled correctly. If a text assertion has a <code>:contains</code> selector, then the text assertion will be changed to an element assertion. Asserted text from multi-line assertions will use <code>self.assert_text()</code> on the first non-empty line. Asserted text from single-line assertions will use <code>self.assert_exact_text()</code>. Element assertions will be handled with <code>self.assert_element()</code>.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>2.0.1</code> adds the ability to preview selectors via the page title when hovering over elements. It also fixes an issue that may occur when opening up new URLs while in Recorder Mode.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>2.0.2</code> fixes a bug with Recorder Mode that was preventing the last recorded assert on a domain from being saved unless it was followed by a non-assert recorded action on the same domain.</p>

<p>ðŸ”´ SeleniumBase <code>2.0.4</code> lets you go back to regular Recorder Mode from Assert Mode by pressing [ESC] once. If you press it again, it will pause the Recorder. (Previously, pressing [ESC] would pause the Recorder right away if using Assert Mode). As before, pressing the <code>{^}-key (SHIFT+6)</code> will switch the Recorder into Assert Element Mode and pressing the <code>{&}-key (SHIFT+7)</code> will switch the Recorder into Assert Text Mode. You can switch back to regular Recorder Mode from Assert Mode by pressing any key other than [SHIFT] and [BACKSPACE]. Also, <code>--codegen</code> can be used in place of <code>--recorder</code> for Recorder initialization, and <code>sbase codegen [FILE.py]</code> can be used in place of <code>sbase mkrec [FILE.py]</code>, which calls attention to the code-generation abilities of the Recorder.</p>
