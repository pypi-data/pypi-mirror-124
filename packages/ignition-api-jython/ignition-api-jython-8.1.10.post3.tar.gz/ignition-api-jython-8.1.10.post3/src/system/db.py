    Database transactions are used to execute multiple queries in an
    atomic fashion. After executing queries, you must either commit the

    transaction which will make all operations since the last commit not
    take place. The transaction is given a new unique string code, which
    is then returned. You can then use this code as the tx argument for
    other system.db.* function calls to execute various types of queries
    using this transaction.

    An open transaction consumes one database connection until it is
    closed. Because leaving connections open indefinitely would exhaust
    the connection pool, each transaction is given a timeout. Each time
    the transaction is used, the timeout timer is reset. For example, if
    you make a transaction with a timeout of one minute, you must
    complete that transaction within a minute. If a transaction is
    detected to have timed out, it will be automatically closed and its
    transaction id will no longer be valid.

    When calling from Vision use:
    system.db.beginNamedQueryTransaction([database], [isolationLevel],

    Args:
        query (str): A SQL query, usually an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
            query, to run.
        database (str): The name of the database connection to execute
            against. If omitted or "", the project's default database
            connection will be used.
        tx (str): A transaction identifier. If omitted, the update will
            be executed in its own transaction.
        getKey (bool): A flag indicating whether or not the result
            should be the number of rows returned (getKey=0) or the
            newly generated key value that was created as a result of
            the update (getKey=1). Not all databases support automatic
            retrieval of generated keys.
        skipAudit (bool): A flag which, if set to True, will cause the
            update query to skip the audit system. Useful for some
            queries that have fields which won't fit into the audit log.

    Returns:
        int: The number of rows affected by the query, or the key value
            that was generated, depending on the value of the getKey
            flag.
