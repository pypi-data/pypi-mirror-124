Description:
    This package cannot be installed. It is intended to be referenced by
    deliberate "bad" manylinux1 wheels.

    Packages can create and upload these in order to indicate to users of
    outdated pip versions that they are not receiving binary packages because
    their pip version is out of date.

    For many packages this is more desirable than attempting to download and
    build the sdist, which will either fail, or succeed but lack features.
