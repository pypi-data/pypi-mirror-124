# Cerebro Toolkit Package
This package provide a systematic process of building and improving software codebase without creating new functionality
that can transform a mess into clean code and simple design architect.
<br><br>
This is a core package of [Cerebro](https://github.com/hieupth/cerebro) because we build everything with engineering mindset which means clean code and good 
software architect is our top concern.
<br><br>
We focus on the package in Python because it is our first programming language but we are working hard to make 
cross-platform support as soon as possible.
