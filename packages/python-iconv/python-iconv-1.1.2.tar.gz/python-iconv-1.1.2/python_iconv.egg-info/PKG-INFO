This is a port of Martin v. Loewisâ€™ original iconv package to Python 3.

The iconv module exposes the operating system's iconv character
conversion routine to Python. This package provides an iconv wrapper
as well as a Python codec to convert between Unicode objects and
all iconv-provided encodings.
