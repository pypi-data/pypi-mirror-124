        PyGerber is a Python library for 2D and 3D rendering of Gerber X3 files.
        It is completely written in Python, and only dependencies are limiting
        its portability.
        
        **This package is a Free Software; it is released under MIT license**.
        Be aware that dependencies might be using different licenses.
        
        PyGerber offers a CLI and API for Python to allow easy rendering of
        Gerber files. Parser was build with GBR X3 format in mind, however, it
        has extensive support for older standards and deprecated features.
        Package is using third party libraries for low level drawing and mesh
        creation.
        
        *PyGerber's parser was not mend to be used by package users, but there
        are no obstacles preventing you from using it. However, stability of the
        API is not guaranteed between minor releases (I'll do my best to make it
        stable among patches).*
        
        **************
         Installation
        **************
        
        PyGerber is available on PyPI and can be obtained via pip
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install pygerber
        
        You can also install the in-development version from github with
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber/archive/main.zip
        
        Blender dependency issue mentioned in previous releases was resolved by
        using `PyR3 package <https://pypi.org/project/PyR3/>`_ which provides
        Blender. **However, blender has to be installed independently from
        package by calling PyR3.install_bpy script**:
        
        .. code::
        
           python -m PyR3.install_bpy
        
        Before You try to use 3D rendering.
        
        ***************
         Compatibility
        ***************
        
        PyGerber officially runs on Python 3.9.* and only on this version.
        However it may be possible to run 2D rendering on other Python versions
        that are supported by Pillow.
        
        I'll consider bringing Python 3.8 3D rendering support, but no sooner
        than after implementation of full set of 3D rendering features and
        macros support.
