"""Template to create a notify class out of that outlines the specific 
criteria to noitfy someone. 

`xNotifyx` is a shorthand name for whatever notification method. Preferably one word and in UpperCamelCase.
Examples: Print, Text, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp...
Once you come up with a name and create a copy of this file, do command-fn-F2 and replace all of `xNotifyx`

Naming: Name the file `xNotifyx`Method.py`. This is important because the __init__ only pulls files that end in Method.py, which is why
`NotifyDecorators.py`, `NotifyMethods.p`y, and `TemplateMethod.py` don't get pulled because they lack the `...Method.py`. Note this file ends in a
`_.py` which is why it won't be auto imported

`NotifyMethods.py` has much of the brains of the operation, look in there for the abstract methods by ctrl-f `@abstractmethod`. Alternatively, 
just look at the template. 

The specific notify function will make it easier on end users to see what specific arguments to specify for your function to help it.

NOTE replace anything is `xNotifyx`
