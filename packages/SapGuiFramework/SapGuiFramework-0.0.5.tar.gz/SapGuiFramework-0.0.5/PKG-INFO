# SAP GUI Framework

A Robocorp Robot Framework library for controlling the SAP GUI Desktop and focused on testing business processes. The library uses the native SAP GUI scripting engine for interaction with the desktop client application. 

Other dependances include the below packages as this library would not be possible without the hard work of so many others.
