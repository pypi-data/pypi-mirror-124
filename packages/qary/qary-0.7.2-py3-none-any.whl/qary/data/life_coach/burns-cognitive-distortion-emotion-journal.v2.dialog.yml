# dialog specification schema version 2.0
# discussed with Jose Robins and team 2021-02-03 at wed night mob programming
#
# Additional features not yet discussed:
#   - next condition: `null` causes the chatbot program to say goodbye and exit
#   - `yes`, `y`, `true` creates a default list of affirmative intents
# If only a single next_condition intent string is found, additional intents are inferred:
#   - If there is another list of intents that starts with a single intent string? use that
#   - state names and keywords (like next_condition) fall back to normalized version that remove spaces, underscores, and fold case to lowercase (like wiki_normalize_text but dont delete/ignore digits)
