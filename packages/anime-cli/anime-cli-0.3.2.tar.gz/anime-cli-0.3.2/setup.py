To achive this a proxy server is used.\n\nYou can install anime-cli from pip using\n```\npip install anime-cli\n```\nThen run using `python -m anime_cli` or simply `anime-cli`\n\nIf you want to help develop `anime-cli`. It is recommended that you clone the repo using and then install the dependencies\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/chirag-droid/anime-cli.git\npoetry install\n```\nand then to run, `poetry run anime-cli`\n\n### Usage Android\n- Download `Termux` from Fdroid\n- Download `mpv-player` from playstore\n\nIn termux install python using `pkg install python`\nFollow the same steps as above for downloading `anime-cli`\n\nWhen asked to enter the video-player change it to `xdg-open` which will automatically open `mpv-player`.\n\n### Motivation\n\nI recently found out about [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli), but it was not cross-platform because it was written in shell, so I decided to recreate that same thing in Python, hoping to make it cross-platform and possibly also have pretty UI.\n\n### TODO\n- [x] Stream on browser\n- [ ] Make streaming on browsers ad free\n- [x] Stream to video player like MPV\n- [ ] Ability to download the shows as mp4\n- [ ] Support for multiple mirrors\n",
