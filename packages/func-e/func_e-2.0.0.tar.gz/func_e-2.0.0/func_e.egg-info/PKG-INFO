Summary: FUNC-E is a python library and script for functional enrichment of gene lists. It follows a similar approach to that of DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) in that it performs enrichment analysis using a Fisher's test but then clusters enriched annotations using Kappa Statistics. FUNC-E allows the user to provide their own annotation lists. It is fully executable on a UNIX command-line.
