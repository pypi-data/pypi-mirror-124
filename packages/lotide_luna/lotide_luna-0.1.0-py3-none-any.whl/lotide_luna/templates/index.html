<h1>Luna</h1>
Luna is a web client for <a href="https://sr.ht/~vpzoom/lotide">lotide</a>.

<h2>What is lotide?</h2>

<p>
  <i>lotide</i> is an attempt to build a federated forum. Users can create
  communities to share links and text posts and discuss them with other users,
  include those registered on other servers through
  <a href="https://activitypub.rocks">ActivityPub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why Luna?</h2>

<p>
  In Latin, <i lang="la">luna</i> means <i>moon</i>, the celestial body that control tides.
</p>

<p>
  I wrote <i>Luna</i> for several reasons, some are personal such as wanting to
  play with Django, some are less personal like wanting an alternative client
  that looks pretty on many screen size (by the time I achieve this goal,
  <i>hitide</i>, the official frontend, will already have resolved the device
  problem, though) or wanting a Rust-free, JavaScript-free client that's
  self-hostable.
