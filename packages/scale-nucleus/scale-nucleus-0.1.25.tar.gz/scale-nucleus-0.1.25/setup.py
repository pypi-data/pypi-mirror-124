To improve production ML, you need to understand their qualitative failure modes, fix them by gathering more data, and curate diverse scenarios.\n\nScale Nucleus helps you:\n\n- Visualize your data\n- Curate interesting slices within your dataset\n- Review and manage annotations\n- Measure and debug your model performance\n\nNucleus is a new way—the right way—to develop ML models, helping us move away from the concept of one dataset and towards a paradigm of collections of scenarios.\n\n## Installation\n\n`$ pip install scale-nucleus`\n\n## Common issues/FAQ\n\n### Outdated Client\n\nNucleus is iterating rapidly and as a result we do not always perfectly preserve backwards compatibility with older versions of the client. If you run into any unexpected error, it\'s a good idea to upgrade your version of the client by running\n```\npip install --upgrade scale-nucleus\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFor the most up to date documentation, reference: https://dashboard.scale.com/nucleus/docs/api?language=python.\n\n## For Developers\n\nClone from github and install as editable\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:scaleapi/nucleus-python-client.git\ncd nucleus-python-client\npip3 install poetry\npoetry install\n```\n\nPlease install the pre-commit hooks by running the following command:\n\n```python\npoetry run pre-commit install\n```\n\n**Best practices for testing:**\n(1). Please run pytest from the root directory of the repo, i.e.\n\n```\npoetry run pytest tests/test_dataset.py\n```\n\n(2) To skip slow integration tests that have to wait for an async job to start.\n\n```\npoetry run pytest -m "not integration"\n```\n',
