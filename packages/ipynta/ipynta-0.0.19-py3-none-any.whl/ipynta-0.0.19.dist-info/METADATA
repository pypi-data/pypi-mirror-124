### Sourcing Classes

Sourcing classes are used for retrieving image datasets from different sources (local drive, zip files, etc.):

- [ImageGlobber](https://github.com/allanchua101/ipynta/blob/main/docs/globbing/ImageGlobber.md)

### Predicate Classes

Predicate classes are used for filtering unwanted data from image datasets.

- [DimensionPred](https://github.com/allanchua101/ipynta/blob/main/docs/predicates/DimensionPred.md)

### Why was it named ipynta?

`I-pinta` means _"to paint"_ in tagalog! This library is proudly developed by a Singapore-based Filipino lad with nothing better to do during evenings.
