# ipynta

**ipynta** is a Python library for different image processing tasks.

## Globbing

Globbing classes are used for sourcing objects from different sources (local drive, zip files, etc.):

## Predicates

Predicate classes are used for slicing / filtering your image datasets.

- [DimensionPredicate](https://github.com/allanchua101/ipynta/blob/main/docs/predicates/DimensionPred.md)

### Why was it named ipynta?

`I-pinta` means _"to paint"_ in tagalog! This library is proudly developed by a Singapore-based Filipino lad with nothing better to do during evenings.
