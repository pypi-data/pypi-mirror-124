"""
This module includes objects inspired by https://github.com/dask/cachey/

We opted for an independent implementation because reusing cachey would have required:

* An invasive subclass that could be a bit fragile
* And also composition in order to get the public API we want
* Carrying around some complexity/features that we do not use here

The original cachey license (which, like Tiled's, is 3-clause BSD) is included in
the same source directory as this module.

def download(*entries):
    """
    Download a local cache for Tiled so access is fast and can work offline.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *entries : Node(s) or structure client(s)

    Examples
    --------

    Connect a tree and download it in its entirety.

    >>> from tiled.client import from_uri
    >>> from tiled.client.cache import download, Cache
    >>> client = from_uri("http://...", cache=Cache.on_disk("path/to/directory"))
    >>> download(client)

    Alternatively ,this can be done from the commandline via the tiled CLI:

    $ tiled download "http://..." my_cache_direcotry

    Use the local copy for faster data access. Tiled will connect to server just
    to verify that the local copy is current, and only download data if there have
    been changes to the copy of the server.

    >>> from tiled.client import from_uri
    >>> from tiled.client.cache import Cache
    >>> client = from_uri("http://...")
    >>> client = from_uri("http://...", cache=Cache.on_disk("my_cache_directory"))

    If network is unavailable or very slow, rely on the local copy entirely. Tiled
    will not connect to the server. (Note that you still need to provide a URL,
    but it is only used to contruct the names of files in the local directory.)
