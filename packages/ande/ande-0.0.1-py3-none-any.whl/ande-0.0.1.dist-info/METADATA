<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>
The world of data is growing very fast, and it is a new challenge for data analysis to develop new methods to handle this massive amount of data. A large number of data have many hidden factors that need to be identified and used for different algorithms. Clustering is one of the significant parts of data mining. The term comes from the idea of classifying unsupervised data. Now-a-days a lot of algorithms are implemented. Besides that, all those algorithms have some limitations, creating an opportunity to innovate new <br>algorithms for clustering. The clustering process can be separated in six different ways: partitioning, hierarchical, density, gridmodel, and constraint-based models. The aim of the package is to implement various types of clustering algorithms and helps to determine which one is more accurate on detecting impure data from a large data set. To create a common platform for Some popluar algorithms for anomaly detection are implemented and converged all of them into a package(AnDe). The algorithms which are implemented and combined into the package are: K-means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. The package reduce the consumption of time by compressing implementation hurdles of each algorithms. The package is also makes the anomaly detection procedure more robust by visualizing in a more precise way along with visualization of comparison in performance(accuracy, runtime and memory consumption) of those algorithm <br>implemented.

## Acknowledgments
<p>
I would like to convey my heartfelt appreciation to my supervisor Prof.Dr. Doina Logofatu,for all her feedback, guidance, and evaluations during the work. Without her unique ideas, as well as her unwavering support and  encouragement, I would never have been able to complete this project.  In spite of her hectic schedule, she listened to my problem and gavethe appropriate advice. <br>Furthermore, I express my very profound gratitude Prof. Dr. Peter Nauth for being the second supervisor of this work.</p>
