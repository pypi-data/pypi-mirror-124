    """Mosaics areas bounded by bounding boxes on image.

    The mosaic bbox node helps to anonymize detected objects by pixelating the
    areas bounded by bounding boxes in an image.

    Inputs:

        |img|

        |bboxes|

    Outputs:
        |img|

    Configs:
        mosaic_level (:obj:`int`): **default = 7**
            defines the resolution of a mosaic filter (width x height). The
            number corresponds to the number of rows and columns used to create
            a mosaic. For example, the default setting (mosaic_level: 7) creates
            a 7 x 7 mosaic filter. Increasing the number increases the intensity
            of pixelation over an area.
