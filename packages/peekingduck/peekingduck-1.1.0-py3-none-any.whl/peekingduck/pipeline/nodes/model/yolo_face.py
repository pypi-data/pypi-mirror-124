    """YOLO node class that initialises and use the YOLO face detection model to
    infer bboxes from image frame.

    The yolo face model is a two class model capable of differentiating human faces
    with and without face masks.

    Inputs:
        |img|

    Outputs:
        |bboxes|

        |bbox_labels|

        |bbox_scores|

    Configs:
        model_type (:obj:`str`): **{"v4", "v4tiny"}, default="v4tiny"**

            defines the type of YOLO model to be used.

        weights_dir (:obj:`List`):

            directory pointing to the model weights.

        blob_file (:obj:`str`):

            name of file to be downloaded, if weights are not found in `weights_dir`.

        graph_files (:obj:`Dict`):

            dictionary pointing to path of the model weights file.

        size (:obj:`int`): **default = 416 **

            image resolution passed to the YOLO model.

        detect_ids (:obj:`List`): **default = [0,1]**

            list of object class ids to be detected where no_mask is 0 and mask is 1.

        max_output_size_per_class (:obj:`int`): **default = 50**

            maximum number of detected instances for each class in an image.

        max_total_size (:obj:`int`): **default = 50 **

            maximum total number of detected instances in an image.

        yolo_iou_threshold (:obj:`float`): **[0,1], default = 0.1**

            overlapping bounding boxes above the specified IoU (Intersection
            over Union) threshold are discarded.

        yolo_score_threshold (:obj:`float`): **[0,1], default = 0.7**

            bounding box with confidence score less than the specified
            confidence score threshold is discarded.
