Description: # scikit-weak (scikit-weakly-supervised)
         A package featuring utilities and algorithms for weakly supervised ML.
         Should be (more-or-less) compatible with scikit-learn!
         It collects original algorithms and methods developed at the MUDI lab (DISCo dept., University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy),
         as well as some algorithms available in the literature.
        
         ## How to install
         You can install the library using the command:
        
         ```
         pip install scikit-weak
         ```
         
         ### Dependencies:
         numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas
        
         ## Documentation
         The documentation is generated using Sphinx (https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). 
         If you download the source code from this repository you can generate the documentation in html format by typing: 
         ```
         sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build/html
         ```
         in the main folder of the project.
