"""
RanDepict Python Package.
This repository contains RanDepict, an easy-to-use utility to generate a big variety of chemical structure depictions (random depiction styles and image augmentations).


Typical usage example:

from RanDepict import random_depictor
smiles = "CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C"
with random_depictor() as depictor:
    image = depictor(smiles)

Have a look in the RanDepictNotebook.ipynb for more examples.

For comments, bug reports or feature ideas, please raise a issue on the Github repository.
