        **For whom is vandal made for?**
        
        vandal is a Python package for Data science and Machine learning, designed to aid researchers and engineers to meet their goals with small effort.
        
        **Why vandal?**
        
        vandal disrupts the monotone world of data and gives it meaning.
        
        **Is vandal free to use?**
        
        vandal is completely free of charge for both personal and commercial use, but only under the conditions stated in the license. Developing such a complex module isn't easy and takes a lot of time and knowledge in several fields of science such as statistics, programming and domain knowledge, so any donation at https://patreon.com/dkundih or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dkundih in order to keep vandal free is more than welcome.
        
        **Who stands behind vandal?**
        
        The module itself, it's maintenance, updates and stability, logo, videos, promotional materials and everything associated with vandal are done by **David Kundih** from **Croatia**.
