# discord.pyc(opy)
## Unofficial copy of an API wrapper for Discord written in Python.


## Why this?
[Original](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) by [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz) was archived by owner.  
But I want to use original discord.py and I decided to create fork.

## Install
```sh
pip install --upgrade discord.pyc
```

## Usage
Same as [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
