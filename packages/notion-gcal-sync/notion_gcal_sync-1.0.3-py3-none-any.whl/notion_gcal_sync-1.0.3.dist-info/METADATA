# Notion-GCal-Sync

Notion-GCal-Sync is a python application to bidirectional synchronize calendar events within notion and google calendar.

## Getting started

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Ravio1i/notion-gcal-sync/blob/main/docs/setup.md).

## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you followed the [setup](https://github.com/Ravio1i/notion-gcal-sync/blob/main/docs/setup.md) and
configured the `config.yml` with your notion token and page for Notion API and gathered and setup
credentials `client_secret.json` for Google Calendar API.

From pip and running directly

```bash
notion-gcal-sync
```

With docker (Not the mounting of `client_secret.json` and `config.yml`)

```yaml
docker run --net=host -it \
    -v $(pwd)/config.yml:/app/notion_gcal_sync/config.yml \
    -v $(pwd)/client_credentials.json:/app/notion_gcal_sync/client_credentials.json \
    notion-gcal-sync
```

On first run or when token is old you will be asked to authorize the application. Follow the link and authorize with your
account. After authorization the application will continue.

```bash
$ notion-gcal-sync
...
Please visit this URL to authorize this application:

```

## Notes

BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:

* This sync will update your source links in gcal. Links to mail etc. will get overwritten with a link to the notion page. The
  original links will be put on top of the description
* This sync will update all your invites from other calendars not specified to your default calendar. There is a button on gcal
  to restore back
* Goals defined from calendar apps are skipped.
* Recurrent original events are skipped. Recurrent occurrences of events are created one by one in notion. Changing in notion
  will change only an occurrence in GCal.

## Notes

With around ~2500 events in gcal the sync:

* to get all events took ~1min
