# Commands

## version

See the latest version of any package or pypi-command-line if no package was specified

How this works is if you specify a package name then it shows the top *limit* latest versions of that specified package, otherwise it shows the current version of pypi-command-line and the latest version of pypi-command-line

### **Demo**

Seeing the current and latest version of pypi-command-line:

![Seeing the latest versions of another package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasi-master/pypi-command-line/main/images/pypi%20version%20with%20package.png)

### **Usage**

> pypi version [PACKAGE_NAME]

### **Options**

- `PACKAGE_NAME`
  The name of the package to show the latest version(s) for. [<span style="color: blue">default:</span> None]

- `-h`, `--help`

  Show the help message.

## browse

Browse for a package's URLs.

This gets the package information, and shows a list containing it's project urls. If the project has a maintainer email set then it also shows that as a mailto<sup>[<a title="mailto is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for email addresses. It is used to produce hyperlinks on websites that allow users to send an email to a specific address directly from an HTML document, without having to copy it and entering it into an email client." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto" target="_blank">?</a>]</sup> that you can press to send a email via your default email client. This gets all the project urls from PyPI and then shows them, there is a known bug where PyPI in some cases shows UNKNOWN for some url so that also gets shown.

### **Demo**

![Demo of the command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasi-master/pypi-command-line/main/images/pypi%20browse.gif)

You can cancel using ++ctrl+c++ if you don't find your desired link

![Demo of cancelling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasi-master/pypi-command-line/main/images/pypi%20browse%20but%20cancel.gif)

### **Usage**

### **Options**

- `PACKAGE_NAME`
  The name of the package to show the urls for.

- `-h`, `--help`

  Show the help message.

## cache-clear

Clears the local packages and requests cache, see [notes](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/notes#cache) for more information about the cache.

### **Usage**

> pypi cache-clear

### **Errors and Warnings**

#### <span style="color: red">E:</span> Failed to delete \<file_path\>

Shown when it cannot delete a file due to some other process using it or not having enough permissions

## cache-information

Shows the size for the packages cache and the size and additionally the websites cached with their creation date and expiry date, see [notes](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/notes#cache) for more information about the cache.

### **Errors and Warnings**

#### <span style="color: yellow">W:</span> Packages cache not available

Shown when the packages cache doesn't exist due to it not being created yet or being deleted recently. You can rebuild that cache using [`cache-refresh`](#cache-refresh)


#### <span style="color: yellow">W:</span> Requests cache not available

Shown when the requests cache doesn't exist due to the `requests-cache` package not being installed

### **Usage**

> pypi cache-information

## cache-refresh

Reloads the packages cache and shows the number of new packages added after the last refresh, see [notes](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/notes#cache) for more information about the cache.

### **Usage**

> pypi cache-refresh

## description

Shows the description of a package as gotten from PyPI or GitHub.

This first gets the information about the package and then finds the descripton. If the package has a descripton it gets the description format, if it's reStructuredText or Markdown then it shows the description formatted according to the format.

If it doesn't get a description in PyPI then it looks for github repos mentioned in the json response gotten from the pypi api. this makes sure it gets the repo if it is supplied no matter where it is. If it finds multiple repos then it asks the user to pick one. Then it uses the github api to find the name of the readme file of the repo, this uses the api instead of manually finding it just in case. Then it reads the contents from the readme file and determines the format using the file extension then it shows the description formatted according to the format.

### **Demo**

## regex-search

Regex stands for Regular Expressions. It allows you to search for all packages in PyPI and only show ones that match a specific Regular Expression<sup>[<a title="A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">?</a>]

If the packages cache is empty it then loads the packages first, the cache is kept for 1 day meaning your data is at most 1 day old. if you want to refresh you may do so by using the [cache-refresh](#cache-refresh) command. For more information about this cache see [notes](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/notes#cache).

### **Demo**

  This removes the table and just shows the package names seperated by commands, it also adds hyperlinks on supported terminals

- `-h`, `--help`
  Show the help message.

## releases

Shows all the available releases for a package.

This can help you determine what versions of a package are available on PyPI.

### **Demo**

![Demo of the command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasi-master/pypi-command-line/main/images/pypi%20wheels.gif)

### **Usage**

> pypi search [OPTIONS] PACKAGE_NAME [VERSION]

- --supported-only

### Wheel Name Syntax

The wheel filename is `{distribution}-{version}(-{build tag})?-{python tag}-{abi tag}-{platform tag}.whl`.

![Image showing a wheel](https://i.imgur.com/6v2ubKU.png)

> <span style="color: #92EC5A;">distribution</span>

- Distribution name, e.g. 'pypi_command_line', 'django'.

> <span style="color: #F2C259;">version</span>

- Distribution version, e.g. 1.0.

> <span style="color: #FFF075;">build tag (<b>Optional</b>)</span>

- build number. Must start with a digit. Acts as a tie-breaker if two wheel file names are the same in all other respects (i.e. name, version, and other tags). Sort as an empty tuple if unspecified, else sort as a two-item tuple with the first item being the initial digits as an `int`, and the second item being the remainder of the tag as a `str`.

> <span style="color: #FF6EF8;">language implementation and version tag</span>

- E.g. 'py27', 'py2', 'py3'.

> <span style="color: #9263FB;">abi tag</span>

- E.g. 'p33m', 'abi3', 'none'.

> <span style="color: #33F1C8;">platform tag</span>

- E.g. 'linux_x86_64', 'any'.

> <span style="color: #33F1C8;">file extension</span>

- E.g. '.whl'.

For example, `distribution-1.0-1-py27-none-any.whl` is the first build of a package called 'distribution', and is compatible with Python 2.7 (any Python 2.7 implementation), with no ABI (pure Python), on any CPU architecture.

The last three components of the filename before the extension are called "compatibility tags." The compatibility tags express the package's basic interpreter requirements and are detailed in [PEP 425](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425/).
