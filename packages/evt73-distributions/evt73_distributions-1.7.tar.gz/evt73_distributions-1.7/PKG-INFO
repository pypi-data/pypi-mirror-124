Description: This package is designed for probability distributions. Therefore, it
        contains two classes for performing calculations and their graphics.
        
        Available distributions: -Gaussian -Binomial
        
        These distributions have some methods such as mean calculation, standard
        deviation calculation, histograms, sum of distributions, â€¦
        
        Each object has its data attribute, so you can put a list on the object
        and perform all calculations
        
        Example:
        
        ::
        
           from distributions import Gaussian, Binomial
        
           dist_gaussian=Gaussian(3, 5)  mean=3, std=5
           dist_gaussian.data=[1, 3, 5, 6 ,2,  1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 8]
