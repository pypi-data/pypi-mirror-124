class FeaturesConfig(object):
    """
    Configuration used to specify a list of features.

    By default, you can add all of the features in a FeatureView to a FeatureService by passing
    the FeatureView into the ``features`` parameter of a FeatureService. However, if you want to specify a subset, you can use this class.

    You can use the double-bracket notation ``my_feature_view[[<features>]]``
    as a short-hand for generating a FeaturesConfig from a FeatureView. This is the preferred way to select a subset of
    of the features contained in a FeatureView. As an example:

    .. highlight:: python
    .. code-block:: python

       from tecton import FeatureService
       from feature_repo.features import my_feature_view_1, my_feature_view_2

       my_feature_service = FeatureService(
           name='my_feature_service',
           features=[
               # Add all features from my_feature_view_1 to this FeatureService
               my_feature_view_1,
               # Add a single feature from my_feature_view_2, 'my_feature'
               my_feature_view_2[['my_feature']]
           ]
       )

    :param namespace: (Optional) A namespace used to prefix the features joined from this FeatureView.
        By default, namespace is set to the FeatureView name.
    :param features: The subset of features to select from the FeatureView.
    :param override_join_keys: (advanced) map of spine join key to feature view join key overrides.
    :param feature_view: The Feature View.
