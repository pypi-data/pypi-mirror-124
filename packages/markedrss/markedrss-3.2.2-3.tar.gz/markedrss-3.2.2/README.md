# Python RSS reader

Final task for EPAM Python Training 2021.09

`markedrss` is a command line utility that makes it easy to view RSS feeds in a readable format.

## Installation

You can install it by running the following command:

    pip install markedrss

In order to install additional dependency to make `--check-urls` work, please, use the following command:

    pip install markedrss[aiohttp]

## Usage

To see help message, please, use `-h/--help` argument: `markedrss -h`.

    usage: markedrss [-h] [-v] [--verbose] [-c] [--clear-cache] [-l LIMIT] [--json] [-d DATE] [--to-html [FOLDER_PATH]] [--to-pdf [FOLDER_PATH]] [--to-epub [FOLDER_PATH]] [--check-urls]
                 [source]

    Pure Python command-line RSS reader.

    positional arguments:
    source                   RSS URL

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help               Show this help message and exit.
    -v, --version            Print version info.
    --verbose                Output verbose status messages.
    -c, --colorize           Print news in colorized mode.
    --clear-cache            Clear cache file on startup.
    -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT  Limit news topics if this parameter provided.
    --json                   Print result as JSON.
    -d DATE, --date DATE     Print cached news published on a specific date.
    --to-html [FOLDER_PATH]  Convert news to .html format and save it by the specified folder path (FOLDER_PATH can be omitted).
    --to-pdf [FOLDER_PATH]   Convert news to .pdf format and save it by the specified folder path (FOLDER_PATH can be omitted).
    --to-epub [FOLDER_PATH]  Convert news to .epub format and save it by the specified folder path (FOLDER_PATH can be omitted).
    --check-urls             Ensure URL represents an image (requires installation of additional dependency, use: pip install markedrss[aiohttp]).

*Some notes*:

+ when `--clear-cache` is passed individually, cache gets cleared and application terminates;
+ `--check-urls` requires internet connection; without passing this argument some URLs representing images may be
  ascribed to `others` category of resulting converted files.

## Logging

There are 2 loggers:

+ general `rss-reader` application logger;
+ `config` logger.

Messages with either `WARNING` or `ERROR` severities are ***always*** printed to `rss_reader.log` file.

`config` logs are only printed to console.

If `--verbose` argument is ***NOT*** passed, then only messages with either `WARNING` or `ERROR` severities
of `rss_reader` are printed to console, `config` logs are not printed to console.

If `--verbose` argument is passed, then all `rss_reader` logs are printed both to console and log file, while `config`
logs are printed to console.

## Configuration

Application creates several files:

+ `cache.json`;
+ `rss_reader.log`;
+ converted to supported formats files: `news.html`/`pdf`/`epub`

By default, the application files are stored in the home directory:

    - Windows: C:\Users\User\rss_reader
    - Linux: /home/username/rss_reader

You can change this by adding `rss_reader.ini` file inside `rss_reader` package.

The structure of `rss_reader.ini` file is the following:

    [rss-reader]
    DEFAULT_DIR_PATH =
    LOG_DIR_PATH =
    CACHE_DIR_PATH =
    CONVERT_DIR_PATH =

The directory path resolution order for storing files, *from lowest to highest priority*, can be found below.

For `rss_reader.log` file:

    home directory -> DEFAULT_DIR_PATH -> LOG_DIR_PATH 

For `cache.json` file:

    home directory -> DEFAULT_DIR_PATH -> CACHE_DIR_PATH 

For converted to supported formats files like news.`html`/`pdf`/`epub`:

    home directory -> DEFAULT_DIR_PATH -> CONVERT_DIR_PATH -> command line arguments 

If `rss_reader.ini` file was given an invalid path or the path was empty, then the directory path gets resolved in the
reversed order.

## Cache JSON structure

Cache represents a dictionary of URLs with according lists of dictionaries of items, preceded by a dictionary of feed
info.

*Some notes*:

+ cache auto-update mechanisms are not implemented, thus it endlessly grows; in order to clear cache
  file `--clear-cache` argument is provided;
+ `--json`-printed results are different from ones, stored in cache; user is usually not encouraged to explore and
  modify cache file (though, he is not forbidden to do so), because it's not a part of the public interface, that's why
  developers have a right to implement it in a handy manner for them, but not in a user-friendly manner,
  whereas `--json`
  argument is a part of the user interface, that's why its output is user-friendly.

`--json` output example:

     {
      "feeds": [
          {
              "title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines",
              "description": "The latest news and headlines from Yahoo! News. Get breaking news stories and in-depth coverage with videos and photos.",

              "language": "en-US",
              "items": [
                  {
                      "id": 1,
                      "title": "Colombia's most wanted drug lord captured in jungle raid",
                      "description": "",

                      "pubDate": "2021-10-23T23:32:33Z",
                      "links": {
                          "images": [],
                          "audios": [],
                          "others": [
                              "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sbSt9k2i59Ne3T5Dahi7dg--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/1fc569ce977352662b4cf3039acae975",

                          ]
                      }
                  },
                  ...
          ...

Why is there a list of feeds inside `--json` structure, not just a single feed? Inside cache file there may be items
with the same `pubDate`, but they may belong to different feeds. So, when there are such items and a user
passes `--date DATE` argument which represents this exact date, then these several items are returned and attributed to
several newly created `Feed` instances. After that, these `Feed` instances are printed. Printing returned news could be
implemented without respect to the feeds they belong to, but in this case it would be hard to distinguish them.

## Parsing XML

XML is parsed by parser implemented from scratch, it exploits the idea of *tokenization* of XML, then dom-tree is created from tokens.

*Features*:
+ XML CDATA parsing support: whenever CDATA is encountered in XML, it gets recursively parsed and substituted by a normal text in the final form.
\
XML CDATA example link: https://rss.art19.com/apology-line
+ detecting invalid XML: parser notifies user with a wide range of messages whenever invalid syntax or some mistake was encountered in XML document.
\
Invalid XML example: https://feedforall.com/sample.xml
\
Its fragment:

      <i><font color="#0000FF">Homework Assignments <br> School Cancellations <br> Calendar of Events <br> Sports Scores <br> Clubs/Organization Meetings <br> Lunches Menus </i></font>

## Testing

Modules tested:
+ _caching.py
+ _builder.py
+ _parser.py

Test coverage is 53%.

In order to run tests, please, install dependencies:

    pip install pytest pytest-cov


And use the following command:

    pytest --cov=rss_reader tests/


## Known problems:

+ big feeds like this one https://feeds.megaphone.fm/WWO3519750118 may get truncated when printing to console because of
  its native limitations;
+ `--colorize` works console-specifically, which implies that in different terminals colorized text may look
  differently.
