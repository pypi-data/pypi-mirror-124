# Spoclify

## warning:
Spoclify currently is only avaliable for Linux.()

Spoclify is a simple command line interface (CLI) for users that, for some reason, might not want to interface directly with the Spotify GUI.

Basic usage is:
```py
spoclify <command>
```

For Spoclify to work properly on your machine, you must create an application at: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and create two env. vars. named **SPOCLIFY_CLIENT_SECRET** and **SPOCLIFY_CLIENT_ID** with the respective values.

Once that is done, you should be ready to use spoclify all you want
