This is a created package for functional operation of SM15K.

### Avaliable oeprations and functions
1. Functions from datasheet [Delta Electronika](https://www.delta-elektronika.nl/upload/MANUAL_ETHERNET_AND_SEQUENCER_PROGRAMMING_SM15K.pdf)
2. Datalogging thread for three type of frames (Basic, Ah and Wh)
3. Watchdog thread for safe operation
4. Charging thread for 3 step charging algorithm
5. Discharging thread for discharging algorithm
6. Cycling thread for battery cycling algorithm

### Used build-in modules
1. [Socket Module / import socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.htmll)
2. [Threading Module / import threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)
3. [Time Module / import time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)

__Note__: Datalogger logs as txt and comma seperated base.

#### Installation
```pip install SM15K```


### How to use it?
#### Code and Syntax Examples
```python
from deltaelektronika import SM15K
import time
```

```python
# IP Address of the power supply, can be obtain the device itself.
IPV4 = '0.0.0.0' 

# To activate debugging option. Creates systemlog file and logs there
#SM15K.activateDebugLogger = True 

# To deactivate debugging option. Creates systemlog file and logs there
SM15K.activateDebugLogger = False 

ColorPrint = SM15K.ColorPrinter()

#Be sure Watchdog timer is higher than sleeptime of the thread
Watchdog = SM15K.WatchdogOperation(IPV4, timer=5000, sleeptime=4)  

# Default color is green, available colors are;
# purple, blue, cyan, green, yellow, red and normal                            
BasicDatalogger = SM15K.BasicDataloggerOperation(IPV4, loggingTime=10,
                printColor= 'purple')    
                
# Default color is green, available colors are;
# purple, blue, cyan, green, yellow, red and normal 
AhDatalogger = SM15K.AhDataloggerOperation(IPV4, loggingTime=10, 
                printColor= 'red')
 
# Default color is green, available colors are;
# purple, blue, cyan, green, yellow, red and normal            
WhDatalogger = SM15K.WhDataloggerOperation(IPV4, loggingTime=5, 
                printColor='blue')  
                            
Charging = SM15K.ChargingOperation(IPV4, sleeptime=5, bulkCurrent=100, 
                bulkVoltage= 14.5, floatVoltage=13.8, floatTime=300)
                
Discharging = SM15K.DischargingOperation(IPV4, sleeptime=5, 
                dischargeCurrent=100, dischargeVoltage=10.5, 
                cutoffCurrent=2)
                
Cycling = SM15K.CyclingOperation(IPV4, sleeptime=5, cycletime=10, 
                bulkCurrent=100, bulkVoltage=14.5, floatVoltage=13.8, 
                floatTime=300, dischargeCurrent=100, 
                dischargeVoltage=10.5, cutoffCurrent=2, restTime=30)
```
> Each functionality has been created with related parameters at above.  
> To be able to use them ```python object.start()``` must be used to start the thread operation
```python
Watchdog.start()        # To start watchdog thread class
BasicDatalogger.start() # To start BasicDatalogger thread class
AhDatalogger.start()    # To start AhDatalogger thread class
WhDatalogger.start()    # To start WhDatalogger thread class
Charging.start()        # To start Charging thread class
Discharging.start()     # To start Discharging thread class
Cycling.start()         # To start Cycling thread class
```
> After calling thread start, if main loop ends, thread is going to end as well
> because of being deamong thread true. That is why infinity loop or long term loop needed to run.
> Or it can be used as thread.join() to be sure that main does not end before the thread is done.

__Note__: Do not operate charging and discharging threads at the same operation.

__Note__: Do not operate Ah and Wh datalogger threads at the same operation. Delta can log one of them at a time.

__Note__: Watchdog is being set to delta itself, that is why be sure timer is bigger than sleep time to have healty operation.

```python
while True:
    # Main Code Runs Here in infinity loop.
    time.sleep(30)
    print(f'Main loop runs in here!')
```
> You can run anything you want here as well to have multifunctional operation while system runs with multiple threads.
>
__Note__: All threads are created as deamon thread which means, if main finishes its operation
threads are going to stop operation. That is why you should keep them in infinite loop.
