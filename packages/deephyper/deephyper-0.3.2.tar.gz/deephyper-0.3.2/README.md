# What is DeepHyper?

DeepHyper is an automated machine learning ([AutoML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning)) package for deep neural networks. It comprises two components: 1) Neural architecture search is an approach for automatically searching for high-performing the deep neural network
search_space. 2) Hyperparameter search is an approach for automatically searching for high-performing hyperparameters for a given deep neural network. DeepHyper provides an infrastructure that targets experimental research in neural architecture
and hyperparameter search methods, scalability, and portability across HPC systems. It comprises three modules:
benchmarks, a collection of extensible and diverse benchmark problems;
search, a set of search algorithms for neural architecture search and hyperparameter search;
and evaluators, a common interface for evaluating hyperparameter configurations
on HPC platforms.

## Install instructions

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install deephyper
```

From Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deephyper/deephyper.git
pip install -e deephyper/
```

If you want to install deephyper with test and documentation packages:

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install 'deephyper[dev]'
```

From Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deephyper/deephyper.git
pip install -e 'deephyper/[dev]'
```

## Quickstart

The black-box function named `run` is defined by taking an input dictionnary named `config` which contains the different variables to optimize. Then the run-function is binded to an `Evaluator` in charge of distributing the computation of multiple evaluations. Finally, a Bayesian search named `AMBS` is created and executed to find the values of config which maximize the return value of `run(config)`.

```python
def run(config: dict):
    return -config["x"]**2


# Necessary IF statement otherwise it will enter in a infinite loop
# when loading the 'run' function from a subprocess
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from deephyper.problem import HpProblem
    from deephyper.search.hps import AMBS
    from deephyper.evaluator import Evaluator

    # define the variable you want to optimize
    problem = HpProblem()
    problem.add_hyperparameter((-10.0, 10.0), "x")

    # define the evaluator to distribute the computation
    evaluator = Evaluator.create(
        run,
        method="subprocess",
        method_kwargs={
            "num_workers": 2,
        },
    )

    # define your search and execute it
    search = AMBS(problem, evaluator)

    results = search.search(max_evals=100)
    print(results)
```

Which outputs the following where the best ``x`` found is clearly around ``0``.
